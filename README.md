# Terrain-Generator

## Description
[Terrain Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenery_generator) is software used to create landscape images, 3D models, and animations. These programs often use procedural generation to generate the landscapes. Base of this code belongs to [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code). We will use this code as educational resource (in video series) for optimizing (minimizing time and process) the solution.
